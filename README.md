This is a repo to fulfill the HTML test repo for Odin Project.

Even though I am familiar with HTML already this is a good refresher in getting back after more than a year of hiatus.

Some skills that I have learned through the Odin Project so far is creating a good commit message and also learning how to be efficient in setting up an HTML. The website does a better explanation on how to navigate directories in a HTML.
